# Chess AI Project

This is a project (currently in development), where I will make a chess bot to play against.

Currently, you can move the pieces, highlight squares and draw arrows. The next update will include move validation, and a simple bot.

I release beta versions that you can play here:

I am also working on a documentation website here:
> https://codepen.io/Paracosm-Arcana/full/VwgodBK

This project is made with [p5.js](https://p5js.org/), which is a JavaScript library.
